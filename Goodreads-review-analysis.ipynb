    "# Analyzing Book Reviews at Different Scales\n",
    "\n",
    "Online book reviews are an abundant source of information on how readers discuss and appreciate books. Reviews often mention the reading experience and how the reader was affected by the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the reception of fiction, one can study professional reviews in newspapers and magazines, but also the millions of online reviews on social platforms like GoodReads and LibraryThing, or book sellers like Amazon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methods that are relevant and appropriate for studying book reviews depends on the number of reviews as well as the selection criteria, such as the source of reviews, and their diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number**: large numbers of reviews provide different kinds of information than small numbers of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 1: For a single or a handful or reviews, close reading is probably the most effective and flexible method. One can read each review in detail, multiple times and make comparisons and connections between the reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - 100: For a few hundreds reviews, close reading them is still doable, but time consuming, and comparing them becomes more difficult with keeping carefully organised notes. Some ways of sorting, grouping and text transforming could also be useful. E.g. ordering the reviews by date or grouping them by book genre or gender of the reviewer. Making frequency lists of words and phrases can give some insight in common themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 10,000: For tens of thousands of reviews, close reading is no longer an option. Some way of algorithmically extracting information from them seems necessary. Text normalisation (collapsing differences in capitalization and morphological variation) will make it easier to identify connections between reviews and between groups of words and phrases. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - 1,000,000: For millions of reviews, there is so much textual data, that small variations in words and phrases become meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source**: First of all the source and type: are all reviews from a single source or from many different sources? On social platforms that allow users to post reviews, readers tend to focus on the book and their reading of it. On book seller websites, reviewers may also include the buying process and the shipping and handling. On personal blogs, reviewers may discuss the book in a wider context, or even review multiple books at the same time. Finally, different platforms allow different ways of writing the review. Some only allow reviewers to use plain text (e.g. Amazon), while others allow emojis and the incorporation of multimedia (e.g. images and videos), which requires different ways of analyzing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diversity**: Second, \n",
    "\n",
    "    - *reviewed books*: assuming each review focuses on a single book, the set of reviews may all be about the same book (to study the reception of a single work), or a small set of books (by a specific (set of) author(s) or in a certain (set of) genre(s)), or a huge set of different books to study the entire domain of online book reviews. In the latter two cases, a further issue is how many reviews there are for each book. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - *review length*: Another \n",
    "\n",
    "    - *reviewers*: are there multiple reviews by the same reviewer? Or all from different reviewers? Some platforms include a reputation system, which allows one to select only reviews from e.g. frequent reviewers, reviewers with some form of recognition, or newcomers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *review period*: are the reviews written over a long or short period? If they cover multiple books, the reviews for very recent books will maybe be written by reviewers who received an advance copy, or by fans who bought the book as soon as they can, while for older books, the reviews can cover a longer period, and include reviewers who only read the book after hearing about it from others, or by reviewers reading it in different time periods with different social norms (e.g. reviews from the mid 1990s vs. reviews from 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at book reviews from Amazon and Goodreads, at different scales and with different levels of diversity, and discuss how scale affects which methods and techniques are feasible and useful, and how different patterns emerge and different kinds of information are revealed."

       "'*Note: No outright spoilers but there are vague references to the book\\'s outcome that could be deciphered. My suggestion if you want to be completely surprised, read this review after finishing the book.Thank God it happened! My faith in the common novel has finally been restored after reading a string of bad to mediocre disappointments. Gillian Flynn has written a novel that kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat. I literally devoured this book in a few sittings. Gone Girl is definitely hype worthy.Nick Dunne wakes up on his 5-year anniversary to his beautiful wife Amy making him a celebratory breakfast. Soon after, Amy goes missing. As the clues are racked up, the world is left to wonder, did Nick kill his wife and if so, why? The motives for murder are introduced rapidly. It\\'s apparent that Nick had plenty of reasons to want Amy dead. Still, with no recovered body, it is impossible to know one hundred percent. As sympathy for Nick with the media as well as those closest to him waxes and wanes depending on the spin dejour, he embarks on an all out quest to clear his name and prove to all that he did not kill his wife in spite of all the evidence mounting against him.Flynn delves deep into the psyche of this particularly troubled yet relatively short marriage. The book is divided into three distinct parts and we learn in the first that both Amy and Nick have lost their trendy NYC writing jobs. Amy, who had a substantial trust courtesy of her parents collaborative and very successful children\\'s book series based on their only daughter, is essentially broke by the time she and Nick move back to his childhood home of Missouri to care for his terminally ill mother and oversee care for his Alzheimer\\'s inflicted father. Things between Nick and Amy begin to unravel pretty quickly from this point. Alternating back and forth chapters between Nick and Amy, with Amy being revealed through a hidden diary she has been writing for several years, the story paces quickly with page turning revelations.One of the things that make this story so engaging is Flynn\\'s attention to detail. She leaves no stone unturned which can be extremely difficult to pull off. There were in the end no \"what about\", questions that came up, at least not for me. This made for a very satisfying book which is tantamount to the reading experience.Also, there is plenty of food for thought after the story ends. The subject matter of relationships, particularly the marital relationship is scrutinized in such a uniquely deliberate way. There is layer upon layer to peel away which is half the fun. All the fears and insecurities that two people bring to their relationship; many of them unseen up front are put under the microscope and brought blaringly to life. The snowball effect and those points in which the principal characters are no longer in control of the outcome exists in stark juxtaposition to the meticulous and calculating aspects of the story even as those characters fight to regain that control. How quickly it all goes from one extreme to the next is a marvel.Flynn\\'s writing is finely honed and her prose is a joy to read. Consider this delightful line on pg. 180 (HC), \"A plant on the mantel promptly lost five pretty purple leaves.\" This line worked so well within the context it was written and what I loved most is that any triteness was relieved by the use of the word \"leaves\" instead of say \"petals\". This is what I loved so much about Flynn\\'s writing, the ability to create the right tone through prose while skating negative connotations.Finally, a word about the ending, a number of the reviews I read had a problem with the way the story ended. It wasn\\'t climatic enough, didn\\'t produce a big enough bang, and seemed to drop off into nothing. These were just some of the things I read regarding the book\\'s ending. I feel strongly that it is a mistake to read any review before reading the book, especially if you are the kind of person who would actually let someone\\'s negative review keep you from reading in the first place. If you do however find yourself perusing what people had to say beforehand, please know that not everyone felt cheated by the ending. I liked it, a lot. It was completely appropriate to the story and brilliantly summed up the characters personalities. It added another layer of depth and authentic dimension. In other words, it was nearly perfect. It was a succinct summary of all we should have learned about these characters as well as the lessons we ought to be taking away from the story, lessons aplenty. Let us not forget that getting to know someone is really much harder than it seems however Amy and Nick managed to get to know each other in a short time under extreme conditions of their own creation.In the end, Flynn boils the most salient points down to their most simple level and reminds us of what is truly at the core of a real marriage, one that exists in real time, day in and day out, with only two people really having knowledge of its crucial dynamics. In a nutshell, this book is so much more than the sum of its parts.'"

But there might be one very long review that compares the book to the movie adaptation, and mentions the word `movie` 60 times. The term frequency of `movie` might be high compared to the term frequency of `book`, but the document frequencies make clear that `movie` is not a common word in this data set. "

This is one of the typical **emergent** patterns in large datasets with contributions from many different people: the amount they contribute tends to be heavily skewed, with the majority of people contributing a small amount of data, and only a handful contributing huge amounts. This results in a so-called power-law distribution of data contributions that has the famous long-tail of heavy contributors. The tail is long because &mdash; graphing the contributed amount on the X-axis and the number of people who contribute that much on the Y-axis &mdash; they all contribute different amounts, creating a long flat tail to the right.\n",
